## Testing Status

### Current Test Coverage
**Initial Status**: Project is in the early stages of test implementation. We are establishing a robust testing infrastructure to ensure code quality and reliability. The current focus is on creating a comprehensive test suite that covers critical functionality.

### Testing Approach
- Implementing comprehensive test suites
- Focus on creating reliable and maintainable tests
- Continuous integration and test-driven development (TDD) principles will be applied

### Next Steps
- Set up continuous integration
- Increase test coverage
- Implement unit and integration tests

*Note: Test infrastructure and coverage will be progressively enhanced.*
